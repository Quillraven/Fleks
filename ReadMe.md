A **f**ast, **l**ightweight, **e**ntity component **s**ystem library written in **K**otlin.

## Motivation

When developing my hobby games using [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), I always
used [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley)
as an [**E**ntity **C**omponent **S**ystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) since it comes out of
the box with LibGDX and performance wise it was always good enough for me.

When using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) you even get nice extension
functions for it but I never was fully happy with how it felt because:

- Defining [ComponentMapper](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#retrieving-components-with-componentmapper)
  for every [Component](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#components) felt very redundant
- Ashley is not null-safe and therefore you get e.g. `Entity?` passed in as default to
  an [IteratingSystem](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/Built-in-Entity-Systems#iteratingsystem)
  although it will never be null (or at least shouldn't ðŸ˜‰)
- Creating [Families](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#entity-families) as constructor arguments
  felt weird to me
- The creator seems to not work on this project anymore or at least reacts super slowly to change requests, bugs or
  improvement ideas
- Although for me it was never a problem, I heard from other people that the performance is sometimes bad especially
  with a lot of [entities](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#entities) that get their components
  updated each frame

Those are the reasons why I wanted to build my own ECS-library and of course out of interest to dig deep into the
details of this topic and to learn something new!

## Who should use this library?

If you need a lightweight and fast ECS in your Kotlin application then feel free to use Fleks.

If you are looking for a long time verified ECS that supports Java 
then use [Artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) or [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley).

## Example game using Fleks

[Dinoleon](https://github.com/Quillraven/Dinoleon) is a small game using Fleks that showcases all functionalities in action!

## Current Status

This branch contains a special Kotlin Multiplatform compatible verion of Fleks. It has a slightly different API when compared with the normal 1.0 release.
But still similar enough that it should not be much work to switch between (normal) release 1.0 and release 1.0-KMP.

Release version 1.0-KMP-RC1 is available on maven central since XX-YYY-2022. Please feel free to contribute to the
Discussions or Issues. Help is always appreciated. 
To use Fleks add it as a dependency to your project:

#### Apache Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.quillraven.fleks</groupId>
  <artifactId>Fleks</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-KMP-RC1</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle (Groovy)

```kotlin
implementation 'io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:1.0-KMP-RC1'
```

#### Gradle (Kotlin)

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:1.0-KMP-RC1")
```

## Current API and usage

### World

The core of Fleks is the `World` which is the container for entities, components and systems and is the object that you
need to update your systems.

To create a world simply call:

```Kotlin
val world = World {}
```

A world without any **system** doesn't make sense and that's why there is a lambda argument for the world's constructor
to configure it accordingly:

- Use `entityCapacity` to set the expected maximum amount of entities. The default value is 512. The reason for this
  setting is to initialize internal collections and arrays with a proper size for your game to avoid a lot
  of `Array.copy` calls in the background which are slow.
- Use `system` to add a system to your world. The order of `system` calls defines the order in which they are called
  when calling `world.update`
- Use `component` to register components and its component listeners (if needed and available, see below) to your world.

Here is an example that creates a world for 1000 entities with a Move- and PhysicSystem:

```Kotlin
val world = World {
    entityCapacity = 1000

    system(::MoveSystem)
    system(::PhysicSystem)

    component(::Position)
    component(::Physic)
    component(::Box2dComponent, ::Box2dComponentListener)
}
```

### System

Usually, your systems depend on certain other things like
a [SpriteBatch](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Spritebatch%2C-Textureregions%2C-and-Sprites#SpriteBatch)
or [Viewport](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Spritebatch%2C-Textureregions%2C-and-Sprites#Viewport). Fleks
uses [dependency injection](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection) for that to make it easier to adjust
arguments of your systems later on without touching the code of the caller side.

First, let's have a look on how to create a simple **IteratingSystem** that gets called every time `world.update` is
called. It is a made up example of a Day-Night-Cycle system which switches between day and night every second and
dispatches a game event via an `EventManager`.

```Kotlin
class DayNightSystem : IntervalSystem() {
    private var currentTime = 0f
    private var isDay = false

    private val eventMgr: EventManager = Inject.dependency()

    override fun onTick() {
        // deltaTime is not needed in every system that's why it is not a parameter of "onTick".
        // However, if you need it, you can still access it via the IteratingSystem's deltaTime property
        currentTime += deltaTime
        if (currentTime >= 1000 && !isDay) {
            isDay = true
            eventMgr.publishDayEvent()
        } else if (currentTime >= 2000 && isDay) {
            isDay = false
            currentTime = 0f
            eventMgr.publishNightEvent()
        }
    }
}
```

The `DayNightSystem` requires an `EventManager` which we need to inject. To achieve that we can define it when creating
our world by using the `inject` function:

```Kotlin
val eventManager = EventManager()
val world = World {
    entityCapacity = 1000

    system(::DayNightSystem)

    inject(eventManager)
}
```

There might be cases where you need multiple dependencies of the same type. In Fleks this can be solved by
specifying a unique type name as parameter in inject() function in world configuration  and in
Inject.dependency() in your system or component listener. Here is an example of a system that takes
two String parameters. They are registered by name `HighscoreKey` and `LevelKey`:

```Kotlin
private class NamedDependenciesSystem : IntervalSystem() {

    private val hsKey: String = Inject.dependency("HighscoreKey") // will have the value "hs-key"
    private val levelKey: String = Inject.dependency("LevelKey")  // will have the value "Level001"

    // ...
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        system<NamedDependenciesSystem>()

        // inject String dependencies from above via their type names
        inject("HighscoreKey", "hs-key")
        inject("LevelKey", "Level001")
    }
}
```

There are two systems in Fleks:

- `IntervalSystem`: system without relation to entities
- `IteratingSystem`: system with relation to entities of a specific component configuration

`IntervalSystem` has two optional arguments:

- `interval`: defines the time in milliseconds when the system should be updated. Default is `EachFrame` which means
  that it gets called every time `world.update` is called
    - The other interval option is `Fixed` which takes a step time in milliseconds and runs the system with that fixed
      time step
- `enabled`: defines if the system will be processed or not. Default value is true

`IteratingSystem` extends `IntervalSystem` but in addition it requires you to specify the relevant components of
entities which the system will iterate over. There are three class properties to define this component configuration:

- `AllOf`: entity must have all the components specified
- `NoneOf`: entity must not have any component specified
- `AnyOf`: entity must have at least one of the components specified

Let's create an `IteratingSystem` that iterates over all entities with a `PositionComponent`, `PhysicComponent`
and at least a `SpriteComponent` or `AnimationComponent` but without a `DeadComponent`:

```Kotlin
class AnimationSystem : IteratingSystem(
    allOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Position::class, Physic::class)),
    noneOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Dead::class)),
    anyOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Sprite::class, Animation::class))
) {
    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        // update entities in here
    }
}
```

Often, an `IteratingSystem` needs access to the components of an entity. In Fleks this is done via so
called `ComponentMapper`. `ComponentMapper` are automatically injected into a system and do not need to be defined in
the world's configuration.

Let's see how we can access the `PositionComponent` of an entity in the system above:

```Kotlin
class AnimationSystem : IteratingSystem(
    allOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Position::class, Physic::class)),
    noneOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Dead::class)),
    anyOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Sprite::class, Animation::class))
) {

    private val positions: ComponentMapper<Position> = Inject.componentMapper()

    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        val entityPosition: Position = positions[entity]
    }
}
```

If you need to modify the component configuration of an entity then this can be done via the `configureEntity` function
of an `IteratingSystem`. The purpose of this function is performance reasons to trigger internal calculations
of Fleks only once instead of each time a component gets added or removed. Inside `configureEntity` you get access to
three special `ComponentMapper` functions:
- `add`: adds a component to an entity
- `remove`: removes a component from an entity
- `addOrUpdate`: adds a component only if it does not exist yet. Otherwise, it just updates the existing component

Let's see how a system can look like that adds a `DeadComponent` to an entity and removes a `LifeComponent` when its
hitpoints are <= 0:

```Kotlin
class DeathSystem : IteratingSystem(
    allOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Life::class)),
    noneOf = NoneOf(arrayOf(Dead::class))
) {

    private val lives: ComponentMapper<Life> = Inject.componentMapper()
    private val deads: ComponentMapper<Dead> = Inject.componentMapper()

    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        if (lives[entity].hitpoints <= 0f) {
            configureEntity(entity) {
                deads.add(it)
                lives.remove(it)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`ComponentMapper` are not restricted to systems. You can get a mapper also from your world whenever needed.
Here is an example that gets the `LifeComponent` mapper of the snippet above:

```Kotlin
fun main() {
    val world = World {}
    val lives = world.mapper<Life>()
}
```

Some systems might need an initialization code that requires the `world`. Unfortunately, it is not possible to
get access to the world in a normal `init` block. The field is not initialized at that time. However, there is
of course a solution. In case you need the world for your initialization logic you can use the `onInit` function of a system like this:

```Kotlin
private class PlayerSpawnSystem : IntervalSystem() {
    override fun onInit() {
        // spawn player when the system gets created
        // Note: access to the world field works inside this method
        world.entity {
            // ...
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

Sometimes it might be necessary to sort entities before iterating over them like e.g. in a `RenderSystem` that needs to
render entities by their y or z-coordinate. In Fleks this can be achieved by passing an `EntityComparator` to
an `IteratingSystem`. Entities are then sorted automatically every time the system gets updated. The `compareEntity`
function helps to create such a comparator in a concise way.

Here is an example of a `RenderSystem` that sorts entities by their y-coordinate:

```Kotlin
class RenderSystem : IteratingSystem(
    allOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Position::class, Render::class)),
    comparator = compareEntity { entA, entB -> positions[entA].y.compareTo(positions[entB].y) }
) {

    private val positions: ComponentMapper<Position> = Inject.componentMapper()

    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        // render entities: entities are sorted by their y-coordinate
    }
}
```

The default `SortingType` is `Automatic` which means that the `IteratingSystem` is sorting automatically each time it
gets updated. This can be changed to `Manual` by setting the `sortingType` parameter accordingly. In that case
the `doSort` flag of the `IteratingSystem`
needs to be set programmatically whenever sorting should be done. The flag gets cleared after the sorting.

This is how the example above could be written with a `Manual` `SortingType`:

```Kotlin
class RenderSystem : IteratingSystem(
    allOf = AllOf(arrayOf(Position::class, Render::class)),
    comparator = compareEntity { entA, entB -> positions[entA].y.compareTo(positions[entB].y) },
    sortingType = Manual
) {

    private val positions: ComponentMapper<Position> = Inject.componentMapper()

    override fun onTick() {
        doSort = true
        super.onTick()
    }

    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        // render entities: entities are sorted by their y-coordinate
    }
}
```

Sometimes a system might allocate special resources that you want to free before closing
your application. An example would be a [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) game where
a system might create a [disposable](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Memory-management)
resource internally.

For this purpose the world's `dispose` function can be used which first removes all
entities of the world and afterwards calls the `onDispose` function of each system.

Here is an example of a `DebugSystem` that creates a [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) 
debug renderer for the physics internally and disposes it:

```Kotlin
class DebugSystem : IntervalSystem() {

    private val box2dWorld: World = Inject.dependency()
    private val camera: Camera = Inject.dependency()
    private val stage: Stage = Inject.dependency()

    private val renderer = Box2DDebugRenderer()

    override fun onTick() {
        physicRenderer.render(box2dWorld, camera.combined)
    }

    // this is an optional function that can be used to free specific resources
    override fun onDispose() {
        renderer.dispose()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        system(::DebugSystem)
    }

    // following call disposes the DebugSystem
    world.dispose()
}
```

If you ever need to iterate over entities outside a system then this is also possible but please note that
systems are always the preferred way of iteration in an entity component system.
The world's `forEach` function allows you to iterate over all active entities:

```Kotlin
 fun main() {
    val world = World {}
    val e1 = world.entity()
    val e2 = world.entity()
    val e3 = world.entity()
    world.remove(e2)

    // this will iterate over entities e1 and e3
    world.forEach { entity ->
        // do something with the entity
    }
}
```

### Entity and Components

We now know how to create a world and add systems to it, but we don't know how to add entities to our world. This can be
done via the `entity` function of the world. Let's create an entity with a `PositionComponent` and `SpriteComponent`:

```Kotlin
data class Position(var x: Float = 0f, var y: Float = 0f)
data class Sprite(var texturePath: String = "")

fun main() {
    val world = World {}

    val entity: Entity = world.entity {
        add<Position> { x = 5f }
        add<Sprite>()
    }
    
    // if needed, you can already access the new entity within the entity{} block
    val entity2 = world.entity { e -> 
        // e is the same as entity2
        // this can be useful in some cases where you want to set the entity as
        // custom userData on certain third-party library objects directly
    }
}
```

There might be situations where you need to execute a specific code when a component gets added or removed from an entity.
This can be done via `ComponentListener` in Fleks. They are created in a similar way like systems meaning that they are created
by Fleks using dependency injection.

Here is an example of a listener that reacts on add/remove of a `Box2dComponent` and destroys the [body](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Box2d#objectsbodies)
when the component gets removed from an entity:

```Kotlin
data class Box2dComponent{
    lateinit var body: Body
}

class Box2dComponentListener : ComponentListener<Box2dComponent> {
    override fun onComponentAdded(entity: Entity, component: Box2dComponent) {
        component.body = // body creation code omitted
        component.body.userData = entity
    }
    
    override fun onComponentRemoved(entity: Entity, component: Box2dComponent) {
        component.body.world.destroyBody(body)
        component.body.userData = null
    }
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        // register component together with its listener to the world
        component(::Box2dComponent, ::Box2dComponentListener)
    }
}
```

## Performance

One important topic for me throughout the development of Fleks was performance. For that I compared Fleks with
Artemis-odb and Ashley in three scenarios which you can find in the **benchmarks** source set:

1) **AddRemove**: Creates 10_000 entities with a single component each and removes those entities.
2) **Simple**: Steps the world 1_000 times for 10_000 entities with an `IteratingSystem` for a single component that
   gets a `Float` counter increased by one every tick.
3) **Complex**: Steps the world 1_000 times for 10_000 entities with two `IteratingSystem` and three components. It is a
   time-consuming benchmark because all entities get added and removed from the first system each tick.
    - Each entity gets initialized with ComponentA and ComponentC.
    - The first system requires ComponentA, ComponentC and not ComponentB. It switches between creating ComponentB or
      removing ComponentA. That way every entity gets removed from this system each tick.
    - The second system requires any ComponentA/B/C and removes ComponentB and adds ComponentA. That way every entity
      gets added again to the first system.

I used [kotlinx-benchmark](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-benchmark) to create the benchmarks with a measurement
that represents the number of executed operations within three seconds.

All Benchmarks are run within IntelliJ using the `benchmarksBenchmark` gradle task on my local computer. The hardware
is:

- Windows 10 64-bit
- 16 GB Ram
- Intel i7-5820K @ 3.30Ghz
- Java 8 target

Here is the result (the higher the Score the better):

| Library | Benchmark | Mode | Cnt | Score | Error | Units |
| ------- | --------- | ---- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| |
| Ashley | AddRemove | thrpt | 3 | 207,007 | Â± 39,121 | ops/s |
| Artemis | AddRemove | thrpt | 3 | 677,231 | Â± 2002,449 | ops/s |
| Fleks | AddRemove | thrpt | 3 | 806,189 | Â± 249,523 | ops/s |
| |
| Ashley | Simple | thrpt | 3 | 3,986 | Â± 1,390 | ops/s |
| Artemis | Simple | thrpt | 3 | 32,830 | Â± 2,965 | ops/s |
| Fleks | Simple | thrpt | 3 | 32,639 | Â± 5,651 | ops/s |
| |
| Ashley | Complex | thrpt | 3 | 0,056 | Â± 0,117 | ops/s |
| Artemis | Complex | thrpt | 3 | 1,452 | Â± 0,452 | ops/s |
| Fleks | Complex | thrpt | 3 | 1,196 | Â± 0,210 | ops/s |

I am not an expert for performance measurement, that's why you should take those numbers with a grain of salt but as you
can see in the table:

- Ashley is the slowest of the three libraries by far
- Fleks is ~1.2x the speed of Artemis in the **AddRemove** benchmark
- Fleks is ~the same speed as Artemis in the **Simple** benchmark
- Fleks is ~0.8x the speed of Artemis in the **Complex** benchmark
