A **f**ast, **l**ightweight, **e**ntity component **s**ystem library written in **K**otlin.

## Motivation

When developing my hobby games using [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), I always
used [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley)
as an [**E**ntity **C**omponent **S**ystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) since it comes out of
the box with LibGDX and performance wise it was always good enough for me.

When using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) you even get nice extension
functions for it, but I was never fully happy with how it felt because:

- Defining [ComponentMapper](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#retrieving-components-with-componentmapper)
  for every [Component](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#components) felt very redundant
- Ashley is not null-safe, and therefore you get e.g. `Entity?` passed in as default to
  an [IteratingSystem](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/Built-in-Entity-Systems#iteratingsystem),
  although it will never be null (or at least shouldn't 😉)
- Creating [Families](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#entity-families) as constructor arguments
  felt weird to me
- The creator seems to not work on this project anymore or at least reacts super slowly to change requests, bugs or
  improvement ideas
- Although for me, it was never a problem, I heard from other people that the performance is sometimes bad especially
  with a lot of [entities](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#entities) that get their components
  updated each frame

Those are the reasons why I wanted to build my own ECS-library and of course out of interest to dig deep into the
details of this topic and to learn something new!

## Who should use this library?

If you need a lightweight and fast ECS in your Kotlin application then feel free to use Fleks.

If you are looking for a long time verified ECS that supports Java 
then use [Artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) or [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley).

## Current Status

After about one year of the first release of Fleks, we are now at version 2.x.
This version combines the **KMP** and **JVM** flavors into a single one.
The history of the 1.6 version is kept in separate branches. Also, the wiki
will contain a separate section for 1.6 for users who don't want to migrate to 2.x
or prefer the other API:
- [1.6-JVM](https://github.com/Quillraven/Fleks/tree/JVM-1.6)
- [1.6-KMP](https://github.com/Quillraven/Fleks/tree/KMP-1.6)

I want to make a big shout-out to [jobe-m](https://github.com/jobe-m) who helped with the first
Kotlin multiplatform version and who also helped throughout the development of 2.0. Thank you!

With version 2.0 I tried to simplify the API and usage of Fleks for new users. This means that
e.g. `ComponentMapper` are no longer necessary and also the API is more in style with typical
Kotlin libraries which means more concise and easier to read (imho).
And of course the big goal was to combine the JVM and KMP branch which was also achieved by
completely removing reflection usage. This hopefully also makes the code easier to understand
and debug.

To use Fleks add it as a dependency to your project:

#### Apache Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.quillraven.fleks</groupId>
  <artifactId>Fleks-jvm</artifactId>
  <version>2.10</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle (Groovy)

```gradle
implementation 'io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:2.10'
```

#### Gradle (Kotlin)

```gradle
implementation("io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:2.10")
```

#### KorGE

```gradle
dependencyMulti("io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:2.10", registerPlugin = false)
```

If you want to use the Snapshot version then you need to add the snapshot repository as well:

```gradle
// Groovy DSL
maven { url 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }

// Kotlin DSL
maven { url = uri("https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/") }
```

## API and examples

The API is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/Quillraven/Fleks/wiki) that
also contains an example section for JVM and KMP projects.

## Performance

One important topic for me throughout the development of Fleks was performance. For that I compared Fleks with
Artemis-odb and Ashley in three scenarios which you can find in the **jvmBenchmarks** source set:

1) **AddRemove**: Creates 10_000 entities with a single component each and removes those entities.
2) **Simple**: Steps the world 1_000 times for 10_000 entities with an `IteratingSystem` for a single component that
   gets a `Float` counter increased by one every tick.
3) **Complex**: Steps the world 1_000 times for 10_000 entities with two `IteratingSystem` and three components. It is a
   time-consuming benchmark because all entities get added and removed from the first system each tick.
    - Each entity gets initialized with ComponentA and ComponentC.
    - The first system requires ComponentA, ComponentC and not ComponentB. It switches between creating ComponentB or
      removing ComponentA. That way every entity gets removed from this system each tick.
    - The second system requires any ComponentA/B/C and removes ComponentB and adds ComponentA. That way every entity
      gets added again to the first system.

I used [kotlinx-benchmark](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-benchmark) to create the benchmarks with a measurement
that represents the number of executed operations within three seconds.

All Benchmarks are run within IntelliJ using the `benchmarksBenchmark` gradle task on my local computer. The hardware
is:

- Windows 10 64-bit
- 16 GB Ram
- Intel i7-5820K @ 3.30Ghz
- Java 8 target

Here is the result (the higher the Score the better):

| Library | Benchmark | Mode  | Cnt | Score   | Error     | Units |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----|---------|-----------|-------|
|         |
| Ashley  | AddRemove | thrpt | 3   | 207,007 | ± 39,121  | ops/s |
| Artemis | AddRemove | thrpt | 3   | 677,231 | ± 473,361 | ops/s |
| Fleks   | AddRemove | thrpt | 3   | 841,916 | ± 75,492  | ops/s |
|         |
| Ashley  | Simple    | thrpt | 3   | 3,986   | ± 1,390   | ops/s |
| Artemis | Simple    | thrpt | 3   | 32,830  | ± 2,965   | ops/s |
| Fleks   | Simple    | thrpt | 3   | 33,017  | ± 3,089   | ops/s |
|         |
| Ashley  | Complex   | thrpt | 3   | 0,056   | ± 0,117   | ops/s |
| Artemis | Complex   | thrpt | 3   | 1,452   | ± 0,452   | ops/s |
| Fleks   | Complex   | thrpt | 3   | 1,326   | ± 0,269   | ops/s |

I am not an expert for performance measurement, that's why you should take those numbers with a grain of salt but as you
can see in the table:

- Ashley is the slowest of the three libraries by far
- Fleks is ~1.2x the speed of Artemis in the **AddRemove** benchmark
- Fleks is ~the same speed as Artemis in the **Simple** benchmark
- Fleks is ~0.9x the speed of Artemis in the **Complex** benchmark
