A **f**ast, **l**ightweight, **e**ntity component **s**ystem library written in **K**otlin.

## Motivation

When developing my hobby games using [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), I always
used [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley)
as an [**E**ntity **C**omponent **S**ystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) since it comes out of
the box with LibGDX and performance wise it was always good enough for me.

When using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) you even get nice extension
functions for it but I never was fully happy with how it felt because:

- Defining [ComponentMapper](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#retrieving-components-with-componentmapper)
  for every [Component](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#components) felt very redundant
- Ashley is not null-safe and therefore you get e.g. `Entity?` passed in as default to
  an [IteratingSystem](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/Built-in-Entity-Systems#iteratingsystem)
  although it will never be null (or at least shouldn't ðŸ˜‰)
- Creating [Families](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#entity-families) as constructor arguments
  felt weird to me
- The creator seems to not work on this project anymore or at least reacts super slowly to change requests, bugs or
  improvement ideas
- Although for me it was never a problem, I heard from other people that the performance is sometimes bad especially
  with a lot of [entities](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/How-to-use-Ashley#entities) that get their components
  updated each frame

Those are the reasons why I wanted to build my own ECS-library and of course out of interest to dig deep into the
details of this topic and to learn something new!

## Who should use this library?

If you need a lightweight and fast ECS in your Kotlin application then feel free to use Fleks.

If you are looking for a long time verified ECS that supports Java 
then use [Artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) or [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley).

## Current Status

Thanks to [jobe-m](https://github.com/jobe-m) Fleks also has a Kotlin Multiplatform version which will be the future for Fleks.
However, since KMP is still in alpha and in my opinion the developer experience is not yet there where it should be,
Fleks will come in two flavors and will also have two releases in parallel:
- **JVM** which can be used for any backend that supports a JVM like native Java applications or Android
- **KMP** which can be used for any platform and can also be used in a [KorGE](https://korge.org/) game

You can find the KMP version [here](https://github.com/Quillraven/Fleks/tree/kmp).
It has a slightly different API for the world's configuration due to limitations in reflection but after that
everything is the same as in the JVM version. And as mentioned above, in the future those
two flavors will be combined into a single one which is most likely the KMP version once I figured out
how to support a similar nice user experience as in the JVM flavor ;)

To use Fleks add it as a dependency to your project:

#### Apache Maven

```kotlin
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.quillraven.fleks</groupId>
  <artifactId>Fleks</artifactId>
  <version>1.4-JVM</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle (Groovy)

```kotlin
implementation 'io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:1.4-JVM'
```

#### Gradle (Kotlin)

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.quillraven.fleks:Fleks:1.4-JVM")
```

## Example game using Fleks

[Dinoleon](https://github.com/Quillraven/Dinoleon) is a small game using Fleks JVM that showcases all functionalities in action!

## Current API and usage

### World

The core of Fleks is the `World` which is the container for entities, components and systems and is the object that you
need to update your systems.

To create a world simply call:

```Kotlin
val world = World {}
```

A world without any **system** doesn't make sense and that's why there is a lambda argument for the world's constructor
to configure it accordingly:

- Use `entityCapacity` to set the expected maximum amount of entities. The default value is 512. The reason for this
  setting is to initialize internal collections and arrays with a proper size for your game to avoid a lot
  of `Array.copy` calls in the background which are slow.
- Use `system` to add a system to your world. The order of `system` calls defines the order in which they are called
  when calling `world.update`

Here is an example that creates a world for 1000 entities with a Move- and PhysicSystem:

```Kotlin
val world = World {
    entityCapacity = 1000

    system<MoveSystem>()
    system<PhysicSystem>()
}
```

### System

Usually, your systems depend on certain other things like
a [SpriteBatch](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Spritebatch%2C-Textureregions%2C-and-Sprites#SpriteBatch)
or [Viewport](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Spritebatch%2C-Textureregions%2C-and-Sprites#Viewport). Fleks
uses [dependency injection](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection) for that to make it easier to adjust
arguments of your systems later on without touching the code of the caller side.

First, let's have a look on how to create a simple **IntervalSystem** that gets called every time `world.update` is
called. It is a made up example of a Day-Night-Cycle system which switches between day and night every second and
dispatches a game event via an `EventManager`.

```Kotlin
class DayNightSystem(
    private val eventMgr: EventManager
) : IntervalSystem() {
    private var currentTime = 0f
    private var isDay = false

    override fun onTick() {
        // deltaTime is not needed in every system that's why it is not a parameter of "onTick".
        // However, if you need it, you can still access it via the IteratingSystem's deltaTime property
        currentTime += deltaTime
        if (currentTime >= 1000 && !isDay) {
            isDay = true
            eventMgr.publishDayEvent()
        } else if (currentTime >= 2000 && isDay) {
            isDay = false
            currentTime = 0f
            eventMgr.publishNightEvent()
        }
    }
}
```

The `DayNightSystem` requires an `EventManager` which we need to inject. To achieve that we can define it when creating
our world by using the `inject` function:

```Kotlin
val eventManager = EventManager()
val world = World {
    entityCapacity = 1000

    system<DayNightSystem>()

    inject(eventManager)
}
```

There might be cases where you need multiple dependencies of the same type. In Fleks this can be solved via
named dependencies using the `Qualifier` annotation. Here is an example of a system that takes two String parameters.
They are registered by name `HighscoreKey` and `LevelKey`:

```Kotlin
private class NamedDependenciesSystem(
    @Qualifier("HighscoreKey") val hsKey: String, // will have the value hs-key
    @Qualifier("LevelKey") val levelKey: String // will have the value Level001
) : IntervalSystem() {
    // ...
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        system<NamedDependenciesSystem>()

        // inject String dependencies from above via their qualifier names
        inject("HighscoreKey", "hs-key")
        inject("LevelKey", "Level001")
    }
}
```

There are two systems in Fleks:

- `IntervalSystem`: system without relation to entities
- `IteratingSystem`: system with relation to entities of a specific component configuration

`IntervalSystem` has two optional arguments:

- `interval`: defines the time in milliseconds when the system should be updated. Default is `EachFrame` which means
  that it gets called every time `world.update` is called
    - The other interval option is `Fixed` which takes a step time in milliseconds and runs the system with that fixed
      time step
- `enabled`: defines if the system will be processed or not. Default value is true

`IteratingSystem` extends `IntervalSystem` but in addition it requires you to specify the relevant components of
entities which the system will iterate over. There are three class annotations to define this component configuration:

- `AllOf`: entity must have all the components specified
- `NoneOf`: entity must not have any component specified
- `AnyOf`: entity must have at least one of the components specified

Let's create an `IteratingSystem` that iterates over all entities with a `PositionComponent`, `PhysicComponent`
and at least a `SpriteComponent` or `AnimationComponent` but without a `DeadComponent`:

```Kotlin
@AllOf([Position::class, Physic::class])
@NoneOf([Dead::class])
@AnyOf([Sprite::class, Animation::class])
class AnimationSystem : IteratingSystem() {
    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        // update entities in here
    }
}
```

Often, an `IteratingSystem` needs access to the components of an entity. In Fleks this is done via so
called `ComponentMapper`. `ComponentMapper` are automatically injected into a system and do not need to be defined in
the world's configuration.

Let's see how we can access the `PositionComponent` of an entity in the system above:

```Kotlin
@AllOf([Position::class, Physic::class])
@NoneOf([Dead::class])
@AnyOf([Sprite::class, Animation::class])
class AnimationSystem(
    private val positions: ComponentMapper<Position>
) : IteratingSystem() {
    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        val entityPosition: Position = positions[entity]
    }
}
```

There is also a `getOrNull` version available in case a component is not mandatory
for every entity that gets processed by a system. An example is:

```Kotlin
@AllOf([Position::class, Physic::class])
@NoneOf([Dead::class])
@AnyOf([Sprite::class, Animation::class])
class AnimationSystem(
    private val animations: ComponentMapper<Animation>
) : IteratingSystem() {
    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        animations.getOrNull(entity)?.let { animation ->
            // entity has animation component which can be modified inside this block
        }
    }
}
```

If you need to modify the component configuration of an entity then this can be done via the `configureEntity` function
of an `IteratingSystem`. The purpose of this function is performance reasons to trigger internal calculations
of Fleks only once instead of each time a component gets added or removed. Inside `configureEntity` you get access to
three special `ComponentMapper` functions:
- `add`: adds a component to an entity
- `remove`: removes a component from an entity
- `addOrUpdate`: adds a component only if it does not exist yet. Otherwise, it just updates the existing component

Let's see how a system can look like that adds a `DeadComponent` to an entity and removes a `LifeComponent` when its
hitpoints are <= 0:

```Kotlin
@AllOf([Life::class])
@NoneOf([Dead::class])
class DeathSystem(
    private val lives: ComponentMapper<Life>,
    private val deads: ComponentMapper<Dead>
) : IteratingSystem() {
    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        if (lives[entity].hitpoints <= 0f) {
            configureEntity(entity) {
                deads.add(it)
                lives.remove(it)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`ComponentMapper` are not restricted to systems. You can get a mapper also from your world whenever needed.
Here is an example that gets the `LifeComponent` mapper of the snippet above:

```Kotlin
fun main() {
    val world = World {}
    val lives = world.mapper<Life>()
}
```

Sometimes it might be necessary to sort entities before iterating over them like e.g. in a `RenderSystem` that needs to
render entities by their y or z-coordinate. In Fleks this can be achieved by passing an `EntityComparator` to
an `IteratingSystem`. Entities are then sorted automatically every time the system gets updated. The `compareEntity`
function helps to create such a comparator in a concise way.

Here is an example of a `RenderSystem` that sorts entities by their y-coordinate:

```Kotlin
@AllOf([Position::class, Render::class])
class RenderSystem(
    private val positions: ComponentMapper<Position>
) : IteratingSystem(compareEntity { entA, entB -> positions[entA].y.compareTo(positions[entB].y) }) {
    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        // render entities: entities are sorted by their y-coordinate
    }
}
```

The default `SortingType` is `Automatic` which means that the `IteratingSystem` is sorting automatically each time it
gets updated. This can be changed to `Manual` by setting the `sortingType` parameter accordingly. In that case
the `doSort` flag of the `IteratingSystem`
needs to be set programmatically whenever sorting should be done. The flag gets cleared after the sorting.

This is how the example above could be written with a `Manual` `SortingType`:

```Kotlin
@AllOf([Position::class, Render::class])
class RenderSystem(
    private val positions: ComponentMapper<Position>
) : IteratingSystem(
    compareEntity { entA, entB -> positions[entA].y.compareTo(positions[entB].y) },
    sortingType = Manual
) {
    override fun onTick() {
        doSort = true
        super.onTick()
    }

    override fun onTickEntity(entity: Entity) {
        // render entities: entities are sorted by their y-coordinate
    }
}
```

Sometimes a system might allocate special resources that you want to free before closing
your application. An example would be a [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) game where
a system might create a [disposable](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Memory-management)
resource internally.

For this purpose the world's `dispose` function can be used which first removes all
entities of the world and afterwards calls the `onDispose` function of each system.

Here is an example of a `DebugSystem` that creates a [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) 
debug renderer for the physics internally and disposes it:

```Kotlin
class DebugSystem(
    private val box2dWorld: World,
    private val camera: Camera,
    stage: Stage
) : IntervalSystem() {
    private val renderer = Box2DDebugRenderer()

    override fun onTick() {
        physicRenderer.render(box2dWorld, camera.combined)
    }

    // this is an optional function that can be used to free specific resources
    override fun onDispose() {
        renderer.dispose()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        system<DebugSystem>()
    }

    // following call disposes the DebugSystem
    world.dispose()
}
```

If you ever need to iterate over entities outside a system then this is also possible but please note that
systems are always the preferred way of iteration in an entity component system.
The world's `forEach` function allows you to iterate over all active entities:

```Kotlin
 fun main() {
    val world = World {}
    val e1 = world.entity()
    val e2 = world.entity()
    val e3 = world.entity()
    world.remove(e2)

    // this will iterate over entities e1..e3
    world.forEach { entity ->
        // do something with the entity
    }
}
```

### Entity and Components

We now know how to create a world and add systems to it, but we don't know how to add entities to our world. This can be
done via the `entity` function of the world. Let's create an entity with a `PositionComponent` and `SpriteComponent`:

```Kotlin
data class Position(var x: Float = 0f, var y: Float = 0f)

data class Sprite(var texturePath: String = "")

fun main() {
    val world = World {}

    val entity: Entity = world.entity {
        add<Position> { x = 5f }
        add<Sprite>()
    }
    
    // if needed, you can already access the new entity within the entity{} block
    val entity2 = world.entity { e -> 
        // e is the same as entity2
        // this can be useful in some cases where you want to set the entity as
        // custom userData on certain third-party library objects directly
    }
}
```

There might be situations where you need to execute a specific code when a component gets added or removed from an entity.
This can be done via `ComponentListener` in Fleks. They are created in a similar way like systems meaning that they are created
by Fleks using dependency injection. The `world` of a `ComponentListener`
is automatically available as a dependency like any `ComponentMapper`.

Here is an example of a listener that reacts on add/remove of a `Box2dComponent` and destroys the [body](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Box2d#objectsbodies)
when the component gets removed from an entity:

```Kotlin
data class Box2dComponent{
    lateinit var body: Body
}

class Box2dComponentListener : ComponentListener<Box2dComponent> {
    override fun onComponentAdded(entity: Entity, component: Box2dComponent) {
        component.body = // body creation code omitted
        component.body.userData = entity
    }
    
    override fun onComponentRemoved(entity: Entity, component: Box2dComponent) {
        component.body.world.destroyBody(body)
        component.body.userData = null
    }
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        // register the listener to the world
        componentListener<Box2dComponentListener>()
    }
}
```

### Family

In case you need to iterate over entities with a specific component configuration
that is not part of a system then this is possible via the `family` function
of a `world`.
A `family` keeps track of entities with a specific config and allows sorting
and iteration over these entities. `Family` is used internally
by an `IteratingSystem`. You can access it via the `family` property.

The following example shows how to
get a `family` for entities with a MoveComponent but without a DeadComponent:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val world = World {}
    val e1 = w.entity { 
        add<MoveComponent> { speed = 70f } 
    }
    val e2 = w.entity { 
        add<MoveComponent> { speed = 50f }
        add<DeadComponent>()
    }
    val e3 = w.entity { 
        add<MoveComponent> { speed = 30f } 
    }

    // get family for entities with a MoveComponent
    // and without a DeadComponent
    val family = world.family(
        allOf = arrayOf(MoveComponent::class),
        noneOf = arrayOf(DeadComponent::class),
    )

    // you can sort entities of a family
    val moves = world.mapper<MoveComponent>()
    family.sort(compareEntity { entity1, entity2 -> moves[entity1].speed.compareTo(moves[entity2].speed) })
    
    // And you can iterate over entities of a family.
    // In this example it will iterate in following order:
    // 1) e3
    // 2) e1
    family.forEach { entity ->
        // family also supports the configureEntity function
        configureEntity(entity) {
            // update entity components
        }
    }
}
```

Families also support `FamilyListener` that allow you to react when an entity
gets added to, or removed from a `family`. Here is an example:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val familyListener = object : FamilyListener {
        override fun onEntityAdded(entity: Entity) {
            // do something when an entity gets added to the family
        }

        override fun onEntityRemoved(entity: Entity) {
            // do something when an entity gets removed of a family
        }
    }
    val world = World {}
    val family = world.family(
        allOf = arrayOf(MoveComponent::class),
        noneOf = arrayOf(DeadComponent::class),
    )
    family.addFamilyListener(familyListener)

    // this will notify the listener via its onEntityAdded function
    val entity = world.entity {
        add<MoveComponent>()
        add<DeadComponent>()
    }

    // this will notify the listener via its onEntityRemoved function
    world.remove(entity)
}
```

In case you need a `FamilyListener` from the beginning to also get notified when
entities are created within a system's constructor then this is possible in a similar
way you can create `ComponentListener`. Just define it in the world's configuration.
In this case the `FamilyListener` must have at least one of the `AllOf`, `AnyOf` or `NoneOf`
annotations. Such listeners follow the dependency injection logic. Here is an example:

```kotlin
@AllOf([MoveComponent::class])
@NoneOf([DeadComponent::class])
private class MyFamilyListener(
    val world: World
) : FamilyListener {
    // ...
}

fun main() {
    val world = World {
        familyListener<MyFamilyListener>()
    }
}
```

## Performance

One important topic for me throughout the development of Fleks was performance. For that I compared Fleks with
Artemis-odb and Ashley in three scenarios which you can find in the **benchmarks** source set:

1) **AddRemove**: Creates 10_000 entities with a single component each and removes those entities.
2) **Simple**: Steps the world 1_000 times for 10_000 entities with an `IteratingSystem` for a single component that
   gets a `Float` counter increased by one every tick.
3) **Complex**: Steps the world 1_000 times for 10_000 entities with two `IteratingSystem` and three components. It is a
   time-consuming benchmark because all entities get added and removed from the first system each tick.
    - Each entity gets initialized with ComponentA and ComponentC.
    - The first system requires ComponentA, ComponentC and not ComponentB. It switches between creating ComponentB or
      removing ComponentA. That way every entity gets removed from this system each tick.
    - The second system requires any ComponentA/B/C and removes ComponentB and adds ComponentA. That way every entity
      gets added again to the first system.

I used [kotlinx-benchmark](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-benchmark) to create the benchmarks with a measurement
that represents the number of executed operations within three seconds.

All Benchmarks are run within IntelliJ using the `benchmarksBenchmark` gradle task on my local computer. The hardware
is:

- Windows 10 64-bit
- 16 GB Ram
- Intel i7-5820K @ 3.30Ghz
- Java 8 target

Here is the result (the higher the Score the better):

| Library | Benchmark | Mode | Cnt | Score | Error | Units |
| ------- | --------- | ---- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| |
| Ashley | AddRemove | thrpt | 3 | 207,007 | Â± 39,121 | ops/s |
| Artemis | AddRemove | thrpt | 3 | 677,231 | Â± 2002,449 | ops/s |
| Fleks | AddRemove | thrpt | 3 | 806,189 | Â± 249,523 | ops/s |
| |
| Ashley | Simple | thrpt | 3 | 3,986 | Â± 1,390 | ops/s |
| Artemis | Simple | thrpt | 3 | 32,830 | Â± 2,965 | ops/s |
| Fleks | Simple | thrpt | 3 | 32,639 | Â± 5,651 | ops/s |
| |
| Ashley | Complex | thrpt | 3 | 0,056 | Â± 0,117 | ops/s |
| Artemis | Complex | thrpt | 3 | 1,452 | Â± 0,452 | ops/s |
| Fleks | Complex | thrpt | 3 | 1,196 | Â± 0,210 | ops/s |

I am not an expert for performance measurement, that's why you should take those numbers with a grain of salt but as you
can see in the table:

- Ashley is the slowest of the three libraries by far
- Fleks is ~1.2x the speed of Artemis in the **AddRemove** benchmark
- Fleks is ~the same speed as Artemis in the **Simple** benchmark
- Fleks is ~0.8x the speed of Artemis in the **Complex** benchmark
